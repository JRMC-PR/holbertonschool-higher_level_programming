# General

>>> Why Python programming is awesome
--- Python programming is awesome because it is a high-level, interpreted language that is easy to learn and use.
     It has a large and active community, a vast library of modules and packages, and is used in a wide range of
     applications, from web development to scientific computing.

>>> How to open a file
--- To open a file in Python, you can use the built-in open() function. It takes two arguments: the name of the file
    you want to open, and the mode in which you want to open it (read, write, append, etc.).

>>> How to write text in a file
--- To write text to a file in Python, you can use the write() method of a file object. It takes a string as an argument
    and writes it to the file.

>>> How to read the full content of a file
--- To read the full content of a file in Python, you can use the read() method of a file object. It reads the entire
    contents of the file and returns it as a string.

>>> How to read a file line by line
--- To read a file line by line in Python, you can use a for loop to iterate over the lines of the file. You can also
    use the readline() method of a file object to read one line at a time.

>>> How to move the cursor in a file
--- To move the cursor in a file in Python, you can use the seek() method of a file object. It takes an offset and a
    reference point as arguments and moves the cursor to the specified position in the file.

>>> How to make sure a file is closed after using it
--- To make sure a file is closed after using it in Python, you can use the close() method of a file object. It closes
    the file and releases any system resources associated with it.

>>> What is and how to use the with statement
--- The with statement in Python is used to ensure that a block of code is executed with a context, and that the context
     is properly cleaned up after the block is executed. It is commonly used with file objects to ensure that the file is
     closed after it is used.

>>> What is JSON
--- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write,
    and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for data serialization and communication between web
    servers and clients.

>>> What is serialization
--- Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can be stored or transmitted.
    In Python, the json module provides functions for serializing and deserializing JSON data.

>>> What is deserialization
--- Deserialization is the process of converting a serialized data structure or object back into its original form. In Python,
     the json module provides functions for deserializing JSON data.

>>> How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
--- To convert a Python data structure to a JSON string in Python, you can use the json.dumps() function. It takes a Python object
    as an argument and returns a JSON-formatted string.

>>> How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure
--- To convert a JSON string to a Python data structure in Python, you can use the json.loads() function. It takes a JSON-formatted
    string as an argument and returns a Python object.

>>> How to access command line parameters in a Python script
--- To access command line parameters in a Python script, you can use the sys.argv list. It contains the command line arguments passed
    to the script, with the first argument being the name of the script itself.
