# How to list the available attibuted and methods of an object?
     we can do that with the buitl in function [dir()]
        it returns a lsit with all the available atts and methods in an object

# Inheritance
    To andd inheritance to a class jsut add the name of the (parent class in the parameter) of the class we are making
            class DerivedClass(BaseClass)
                <statment-1>
                '
                '
                '

isinstance() and issubclass() are both built-in functions in Python that are used to check the type of an object or a class, respectively.

isinstance() is used to check if an object is an instance of a class or any of its subclasses. It takes two arguments: the object you want to
check and the class or tuple of classes you want to check against. The function returns True if the object is an instance of the specified class
 or any of its subclasses, and False otherwise.

issubclass() is used to check if a class is a subclass of another class or any of its subclasses. It takes two arguments: the class you want to
check and the class or tuple of classes you want to check against. The function returns True if the first argument is a subclass of the second argument
 or any of its subclasses, and False otherwise.the object you want to check and the class or tuple of classes you want to check against. The function returns True if
